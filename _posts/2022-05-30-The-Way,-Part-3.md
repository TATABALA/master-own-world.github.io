**LESTER:** Maybe we ought to take off where we left off last night. You guys got some deep realizations. I don't know where they're aware of it, and by habit could be B put aside. If I talk about it'll probably come out different anyhow than it did last night. It’s really good. Yes, the guys will tell you what it was, but it was, oh, “Be not the doer.” Who wants to be a door? [LAUGHTER] Because I've been out the door. [LAUGHTER]


**STUDENT:** Is this okay to be a window? [LAUGHTER]

**LESTER:** You can see to it. [LAUGHTER] You can see the light through the window. And in general, there was a lot of question on what does it mean be not the doer. So, I think I start off by saying, well, I told you to release to get everything you want. When you are released, you have no sense of doership, everything falls into line. Right? That's it.

When you are released, you experience the sense of being not the doer. So that ought to connect for every one of you. When you completely released, it just happens with no effort. And so, you sit by back and watch it happen is the experiencing you go through. That's being not the doer. 

Oh, you can't stop action. You cannot go into inaction because of your karma. But you should use the action, to grow by the action. And one of the big biggies is be not the door. Watch it happen, in your senses you're sitting in a theater, watching the show go on when you be not the doer.

The newer ones to this idea, have any question on it? I think the three of you us have had a real good experience. But it means to not be the doer. Let me question in the sense of being an action and being not the doer. W

**STUDENT:** I don't know why I have a question, because this is what I was working on last night. Was not next. [LAUGHTER] [INAUDIBLE]

**LESTER:** Stealing my show? [LAUGHTER]

**STUDENT:** Maybe I was hearing your show before. [LAUGHTER]

**LESTER:** You could. [LAUGHTER]: But I got to the point where, um, and this is what confused me, where even my will senses [INAUDIBLE]

**LESTER:** It is. [LAUGHTER] 

**STUDENT:** But at that point…… 

**LESTER:** If you can be not the doer. But if you cannot be not the doer, then will is usable. Will is effort - efforting to undo the effort. But there's a power in you. It's a willpower, where you can decreed if you will. Now, willing is good because you could pull out the whole thing is, if you're so decided, I've yet to see the first one do it. Okay, so what's your question now? 

**STUDENT:** You just answered it. Thank you. 

**LESTER:** See, without I was able to explain it relative to something that was going on. He wanted to make a preparation for somebody to do something that he would like them to do. And he asked me if I'd call that party, and I said no. Well, in his idea, you had it good. D-D-D-D-D-D-D. Get ready for it. 

My concept was in a matter of 30 seconds, I'll have the whole thing completed when I see this person, because I'm not the doer. It happens right away if I continue to be not the doer. If I am the doer, then I got preparations, I got to do convincing, I got to do asking, a lot of roundabout stuff. But when you're not the doer, it's the sense of letting go and letting God do it. You actually sit by and watch the body action go on, just as you would a moving picture of your body.

I think you've all experienced times when you were not the doer and you saw things happen, right? Right? So, you've all experienced it. And experience is the main thing that we need to use to learn. We cannot learn intellectually through the mind, through the head. The mind is the enemy; the mind is the obstacle. The only way we can learn is through experiencing. And each, and every one of the six of you has experienced being not the doer and watching the thing fall into line without effort.

All right, now, the thing to accomplish is to have that happen all the time. When it did happen, was it miserable? [LAUGHTER] But every time you effort, you're unhappy, you striving, you struggling. Every time you effort, you're not happy, but the moment you let go, identifying yourself as being the body, things are effortless. I say, a body-mind, opposite size of the same coin, the mind in the body, the mind says the body is there.

So, experiencing something, you should know the difference between the intellect and experiencing the everything you’ve, you accumulate, even now in the intellect, you're going to have to drop to get that intellect, that mind totally quiet. Everything you've learned in your lifetimes; you're going to dumb after which you're omniscient, after which you're in touch with your Beingness which is omniscient. And what thinking would omniscience required? Everything is known, what is there to think about?

So, you shift from using your head, which is your block, to quieting that head, so you just remain your Beingness, and everything is effortless. Everything falls perfectly into line, and you're in the perfect happiness that there is. That's really your basic nature. [DOG BARKING] I’ll thank you shooting at me. [DOG BARKING] [LAUGHTER] sports, cause they paused. [INAUDIBLE]

You know, I feel like stopping there. It's such an important, powerful point. I feel that I talk on further, I just diluted. So, let's stick to that as being the point of this meeting. So, could you keep a record what the major topic was of each meeting? You’ve got W the first four, have you not? [INAUDIBLE] I'm at first five, and make this number six, because some day we want do it again.

**STUDENT:** [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHTER]

**STUDENT:** I missed most. No, I had this summer. [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHTER]

**STUDENT:** Okay.

**LESTER:** I remember in the early days, they put a tape recorder on, and that's the August that were not on. Now, it would go and when it replayed, it was blank. **Nothing out there but your picture**. And for some years, when anyone took a picture of me, I wasn't on the picture. And if it was a crowd, everyone would come out but me. Until Neve Adele came to town and had a national conference here, she kind of put me up high and, oh, I must be in the picture. So, I said, “Oh, Lord, better come out this time.” [LAUGHTER] In that time on my picture comes out now when people shoot it, but it's just another example.

**There’s nothing out there but your consciousness.** I know what did it. Oh, I'm not that body, that body is just an imagination, so, it didn't come out. You know I'm a negative [INAUDIBLE], nor on the positive. [LAUGHTER] Okay, so, turn it off.

**STUDENT:** I have a question. This is gonna say, like a funny question, but what do you, what do you, how do you, uh, get yourself into the place of them being do it? Is there…… 

**LESTER:** What me? I just say, “I'm not the doer,” that’s it. [LAUGHTER]

**STUDENT:** How did I do it? 

**LESTER:** Practice.

**STUDENT:** Practice.

**LESTER:** Of course. The very best ways I said before is releasing. When you're released, you're not the doer. That bothers you sometimes. W

**STUDENT:** What seems like things happen? You don't really…… 

**LESTER:** That’s it, things happen. You don’t have to do them; they just do you in. But the senses that release until let go when it happens. And with a sense of letting go and letting God, you don't have to do it, then you just watch it happen, you are not the doer. Did that answer your question? 

**STUDENT:** It’s…… [INAUDIBLE]

**LESTER:** It's experiential. You're not gonna get it in the head. 

**STUDENT:** Right.

**LESTER:** You're going to get it in you experience, I'm dead. [LAUGHTER] 

**STUDENT:** Really clppy. [INAUDIBLE]

**LESTER:** So, you get it in the experience, not in the head. If you want to understand it, come back and out in a million years, you still won't understand it.

**STUDENT:** Well, I don't understand it, but I have its experiences, so I just keep going.

**LESTER:** That's it! It's the experience. I had to tell you a friend tell me that, she said, “It's understanding.” I says, “No, understanding will keep you from being free.” What did she look at me? This was two times ago, so yesterday she said, “I think I understand what you mean.” [LAUGHTER] She wasn't positive, but she thought so. 

Anyhow, understanding is new W worlds of duality in the realm of Maya, I understand something. We’re in the realm of Beingness is no understand. Everything is known that needs to be known. But what needs to be known? One thing only, one thing only. How long would it take you to know one thing that you are your Beingness? That's all you need to know.

If you just only be your Beingness. That's the experienced. It covers everything when you say, “Oh my gosh, I’ve always been omnipotent, omniscience, omnipresent.” You are so right now. So spread your wings, be not the doer, just fly high. 

A question? 

**STUDENT:** I did. It was just the sense of, feels like I try to make myself be the doer that's still…… [INAUDIBLE] 

**LESTER:** Control, trying to control you. No, you just, you can, so let go. **It's not gonna make yourself do, it's a sense of letting go, and letting it be.** It's experiential. Again, you've experienced it.

**STUDENT:** Just walking over here. 

**LESTER:** So, trying to explain an experience that it would be like trying to tell you how to fly an aero plane or even drive a car. You've never been in automobiles, they just put the key and put the shift into drive, step on the gas, and you go. You want to go right? To turn the wheel right. You want to go left. Could you drive? I've told you everything you need to know just now about driving a car, but could you drive it? No. you need the experience. It was strong would be an airplane. I can tell you how to fly an airplane. W Go up there and down here quickly. Experience is what cast into it on a bicycle, I can tell you how to ride a bicycle, but you'll never know how until you experience it, and once you experience it. You can't intellectually transfer and experience to someone else. They must experience it for themselves. 

So, there's a distinct difference between experience and intellectual understanding. The intellectual understanding will not give you the ability to experience. It will lead you toward the experience, but it will not give you an experience because it isn't. It's in the head. It's thinking this. It's not experiencing. 

**STUDENT:** I've been recently just looking at all the concepts I have here, including the spiritual ones, like I'm not the body. And one thing, a way of working, want to make sure I'm going in the right direction, is even money go of that belief. Because when I let go of the belief, I very often get morphs an inner experience of that concept, as opposed to the just the concept. 

**LESTER:** I am not the body. Is it admitting a body, isn't it? That's the trickiness of the mind. Mind will just trick you, break you, shove you, keep you believing you’re uh infinitesimal body. The function of the mind is limitation. So, when you let go of the mind, what's left over is your Beingness. That's it, and it's there right now, unlimited. Maybe we need a banner “unlimited” on with it.

**STUDENT:** I didn’t do this. I'm not the doer. [LAUGHTER] I didn’t do it. [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHTER]

**LESTER:** Is a kiddy did?
