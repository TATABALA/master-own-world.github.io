**LESTER:** At this point time, give you anymore, I'm giving you too much. How do you feel about it? How do you feel about what I gave you so far? 

Well, here's the points. The first one was: **You want the world more than you want freedom**. Second: **Take all your joy from within by releasing**. Next: **Make the decision to go free and then do it**. Next one: **Released directly the fear of dying**. And that's a tough one for you, because you think if you release it, you'll die. The next one is: **Get everything you want from here on by releasing**. I think that's the one I like best, practically, it'll do more for you than anything else.

Can you see why? You'll be releasing every moment, [LAUGHTER] because you're overloaded with want, want and wants. How successful have you been on getting everything you want from here on by releasing? Is it working for any of you that everything you want now, you let go and let it come into your experience? Who’s experiencing getting everything you want by releasing? Anybody? 

**STUDENT:** [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHTER]

**LESTER:** Oh, everything, everything means everything. [LAUGHTER] What? Said you something? 

**STUDENT:** I'm can't say it for us. [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHTER]

**LESTER:** Say it for.

**STUDENT:** I would say pretty much. [INAUDIBLE]

**LESTER:** Pretty much.

**STUDENT:** Yeah.

**LESTER:** Well, much as much. 

**STUDENT:** It seems like things happen.

**LESTER:** That's the way you should saying, things just happened. So, I left out the last one - **be not the doer**. Because if you do that, you're not the doer.

**STUDENT:** That's the one that I've been doing a lot of work.

**LESTER:** Be not the doer? 

**STUDENT:** And release the work that I'm involved. And I always feel that I have doer, so I catch myself. [INAUDIBLE] And that's so that's the one that's…… 

**LESTER:** You let go and you be not the doer.

**STUDENT:** [INAUDIBLE]

**LESTER:** It's releasing only to be the ego. [INAUDIBLE] That's why we have it open, the door goes out the door. And the…… [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHTER] But these are powerful things, very powerful if you can make a constant habit of one of them, any one of them, will get you all the way.

**STUDENT:** There's another one: Behave like a master - Whatever you do, do it to perfection. 

**LESTER:** That's the one I got a space for here. I forgot it. Can I borrow your pen? But was that a full session, or just part of the session.

**STUDENT:** [INAUDIBLE] 

**LESTER:** “Make your behavior that which a master would do.” Is that correct in English? Make your behavior that which…… anyway you understand that a master would behave like or do. 

**STUDENT:** The same [INAUDIBLE] behave like a master. Whatever you do, do it to perfection. 

**LESTER:** Yeah, but…… [INAUDIBLE] I'm more direct. I say, make your behavior. You see the difference between what you put it away?

**STUDENT:** [INAUDIBLE]

**LESTER:** Yeah, behave like a master and saying some, I'm a silly girl, [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHTER] Where I give it to you. Yeah, it's direct. Make your behavior. Should I say like that of a master?

**STUDENT:** That's different. He also said the work to perfection. If that kind of throws us you indicated. Are you added? Whatever you do, do it successful?

**LESTER:** Yeah. Well, that's the way a master does things. That's one of the things I would apply to doing it as a master would do it. The more imperfectly that we work, the lower down the scale we are, no matter what the thing is that we are doing. So, the one you like best is, which one…… 

**STUDENT:** I didn't say I liked best. I just said…… 

**LESTER:** Using most. 

**STUDENT:** One I use most is get everything through releasing. I like that. 

**LESTER:** I like that the best too. 

**STUDENT:** Because…… it does make it more constant [INAUDIBLE]

**LESTER:** Because you can see why it's the action required to go free, **the most directed action to go free is releasing.** [INAUDIBLE] ……the obstruction.

So today we're going to have Releasing-102. The first time it was Releasing-101. If you've gotten a college, you know what that means? [LAUGHTER] I don't know whether they did in your college.

**STUDENT:** Yeah. [LAUGHTER] 

**LESTER:** Even back in my days, the first course was 101, and the second course 102, in therefore let go of it. So today, Releasing-102, that means by next time, everyone has to release a hundred and two times, I get put back one grade. Can you suggest anything that will keep you reminded that take them get everything you want by releasing?

**STUDENT:** Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHTER]

**LESTER:** I take a photo. [INAUDIBLE]

**STUDENT:** I like the banner story. [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHTER]

**LESTER:** Do you all have in your room? The sign? It is a most effective way of going free.

**STUDENT:** [INAUDIBLE]

**LESTER:** We got a spy here now. [LAUGHTER] Make sure you go free. Right now, is it working for all of you that you're getting things without effort?

**STUDENT:** It’s, it’s step down. [INAUDIBLE]

**LESTER:** The effort stepped down, but he's getting it stepped up. [LAUGHTER] Was there any time to guide effortlessly?

**STUDENT:** I guess. 

**LESTER:** No effort at all, just dropped into your hand. [INAUDIBLE]

**STUDENT:** It’s not constant. [INAUDIBLE]

**LESTER:** Okay, now that's the experience of being yourself with the capital “S” of being your Beingness. It has to be effortless when you're being your Beingness. But recognize these things because it will help you and encourage you to do it more. So, until the whole world drops into your lap effortlessly. Would that be nice? And now, once that gets to be your habit, then you discover you can create anything by mere effortless thought. It drops into your lap. 

**STUDENT:** Have you got a bigger lab now? [INAUDIBLE]

**LESTER:** Well, we'll set out a handout here where everything can drop into. We got lots of acreage here. [LAUGHTER] But we better put a lap pad so we can map up the world. [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHTER] It's a tremendous, a tremendously delightful experience when you do it that way. Have you noticed that? 

**STUDENT:** Don't bring someone plans to. [INAUDIBLE]

**LESTER:** Yeah, because as you go free, your resistance to allowing the rest of it to come up gets less, as you get freer, your resistance to allowing the remaining garbage to come up gets less, until someday all the fear of dying come up and run out on its own push.

But you have to open the door, that’s the button, ask it to come up, **because every piece of suppressed feeling is under pressure to expand itself, so the higher you go, the less you're resisting the remaining suppressed energy - AGFLAP, and the more it'll come up**. But when it starts coming up, please let it go. It singing that song, “Let it go. Let it go. God bless it”.

You catch these things, you might complete the journey, which consists of getting right back to where you are right now, which means you really stop journeying away. You'll stay in a nice place all the time, the best place. You’ll be a nice world if you didn't have to work and scratch for a living, depend on air, water, food. Just sit back and be and B and B and B. So, we will be the four B people. We will just be and B and b and b and b.

One shakes. There was a very high individual said, “To be or not to be, that is the question.” He added it upside down. To be or not to be is the answer. And the answer is to B and b and b and b, and that’s the ultimate state we’re just being. W What you're doing right now but using tremendous effort to look away from trying to be a limited body mind. So, mind you let go of the mind, let go of the body and just b and b and b and b.

If you hear the buzzing, that's the own [INAUDIBLE] sound. It won't bumble. It will be nice and smooth.

I feel as though I ought to stop here, because what I'm saying is so deep and so powerful, and you’re feeling it, and for me to talk further would just take you away from your just being and being and being and being. That's where the word “bingo” comes from. When you're just being - Bingo. That's it. So, I'm gonna conclude saying: Keep it up until you can just only be and be and be and be.
