**LESTER:** The basis of our philosophy is very simple and is: Each one of us has no limits whatsoever, except those that we hold on to mentally. If we release the mental restrictions, limitations, bondages, we discover we have always been unlimited. We have always been all-powerful, all-knowing, perfect. Because our basic nature is perfect, there’s nothing we can do about it, except look away from it all the time - Where is it? Where is it? Where am I? Where am I? Like a bunch of drunks, trying to discover who and what we are.

However, the part of us has blinding us from seeing this unlimited Being that is inherent and natural is what we call our mind, which 24 hours a day, unconsciously, is looking for the absolute security out there in the world where it is not. So, everyone is engaged 24 hours a day subconsciously in the wrong direction, looking for What am I? Who am I? Where am I? Where’s my security? And a 100% hopeless, fruitless, but very frustrating direction.

If your basic nature is whole complete eternal, why do you spend every day scratching for a living? Well, the kind word would be “ignorance” of the factual stuff that I gave you just before this. Any smart one would say, “Gee, if I'm all that, I'm going to be that pronto.” It doesn't need to take time to be what you are, it takes zero effort to be what you are, but to be what you're not - to be limited, takes endless effort, struggle, unhappiness, frustration, etc. 

Now, all of you have probably heard what I said. How many smart ones do we have in this room who have let go of struggling for it where it is not and have just allow the infinite Beingness that you are to be so that you have an effortless, extremely happy life every moment? How many of us have done? You’re preferring to be miserable. You’re preferring to be in my eyes as stupid as you can be. If you could have anything for a mere effortless thought, why all the struggle?

I'm calling you stupid because I think it might help you. Is there anyone here who does not want to be smart? So, get smart! If you need the world, work it by effortless thought, allow it to drop into your lap, let go of all your misery. It's easy, it's simple, and it's quick if you do it. If you don't do it, it's complicated, extremely unattainable, frustrating, miserable. But the choice is yours. You could be the being that you are right now, whole complete perfect. Or you can choose to look away from it all the 24 hours of the day.

So, what are you going to do the next month or two? Be smart or be stupid. I'm gonna give you the answer. I hope I'm wrong. I think you're gonna be stupid. But I cannot figure out why you choose to be stupid, because the first thing I recognized in me was when I was looking for the answer that I was stupid. But I said it not once. I said, “Lester, you are stupid, stupid, stupid,” three times, and I meant it, so you hear me talking about stupidity. I didn't want to be stupid.

And that was the bottom line of turning me around. Of course, the next thing is looking in the right direction. I know it wasn't out there. I spent 40 some years trying to get it out there, ended up at the bottom. So, there was only one will play left to go inward - What am I? What’s this world? What’s my relationship to? What's it all about? [INAUDIBLE] And the method, without the method, the answers came to me, arrived after was over I could see the steps I took, packaged it into the method, which is a very effective technique, but you use it partially, minimally instead of fully, maximally. If you use it maximally, it only take you a few months, and you'd have no more suppressed feelings.

The only thing between you and the ultimate happiness is suppressed feeling. So, it behooves you to make the decision to stop being stupid and getting smart and releasing all these suppressed feelings in a month or two. I don't think I could give you a better message than that. I could say you could do in a century or two. But why not now? You are this unlimited being right now. Why not just let go of, release all the blinders, which are all out together in the feelings?

Okay, are there any questions on what I’ve said? I'm terminating what I have to say, dear, right there.

**STUDENT:** As she said, people acting like me is their spiritual rather than being spiritual. I give sense. [INAUDIBLE]

**LESTER:** Yeah, I walk around and I smile on my face, everybody around me, I give a hug, and I say, I belong to a spiritual organization. And so that acting, it's pretense. You’ll find it. 

I'm almost sorrowfully throughout the metaphysical community, and Sedona is a good gathering in place for that community. But you have it everywhere. It really comes under one word, tried. Many physical, spiritual people get hung up and pride - I know more than the others; I have a closer tie to God; I know where the vortexes are of energy. [LAUGHTER] And that's wrong vortexes of all energy is in the “I” of you.

I hear somebody take me to the [INAUDIBLE] vortex. I'm walking around with the Zora [INAUDIBLE], and I said, “Where is it?” She says, “You're on it.” I said, “Where?” She says, “The rock.” And I says, “Oh my gosh.” I wanted to experience, and I couldn't get any feeling of any lifts from rock. And I said, “Well, then have rocks in your head to believe that.” [LAUGHTER] That's true.

All the power in the universe is in the “I” of you. You say, “I am.” Don't give it away to rocks, you’ll be, you'll be between the rock and the hard place. [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHTER]

Can I answer your question? 

**STUDENT:** Yeah, I guess, um, and I think that's the difference. If the feelings they have now about others having been releasing from six months, I think the hell that was for for me, in terms of how I thought about loving, and I can see a big difference, um, sure, after, 

**LESTER:** Yeah, but……

**STUDENT:** but, um, sort of releasing as…… 

**LESTER:** Releasing your non-love feelings. So, your basic in here and nature is Christ-like, that's the nature of every one of us, and it's covered over by the veils of non-love feelings - everything but love is a non-love feeling. So, you must let go of all those feelings, and what's left over is pure love. You don't need a PhD to understand it. Actually, [INAUDIBLE], because they're trying to get it via the head, and the mind is the obstacle. It's the mind that holds all the limitations. But in your Beingness, you're unlimited.

I say, “Are you?” You say, “Yes.” I say, “That's it.” Why all this trouble? – “Being an extremely limited carcass,” that I answer your question now. 

Any other question? 

**STUDENT:** So, as I listen to say that, I give this, can't feed them. It was starving. [INAUDIBLE]

**LESTER:** Don't release it. [LAUGHTER] Let's see what I'm doing to…… [INAUDIBLE] Why didn't you release it? 

**STUDENT:** I guess this surprised me…… [INAUDIBLE]

**LESTER:** Oh, okay, you want to be miserable and hold on the feelings, “God bless” is the only thing I can say. But that's the answer, whatever person you're gonna ask and now ask me, 

**STUDENT:** But actually that's the answer to the expression. Sometimes working just my mind grabs it, and I don't please you, because of [INAUDIBLE]

**LESTER:** The words are run you away - talking about it is in place of doing it, and this is what you are about to do.

So, I said don’t release, suffer, it feels awful, suffer. [LAUGHTER] He smiles at me and likes I suffer, instead getting angry and wanting to kill me, because he knows what I mean.

It's a choice to suffer or to be the ultimate happiness, which is your basic nature. Your Beingness is God-Beingness - God’s infinite Beingness of the universe. Therefore, I must include your Beingness.

So, when you identify with your Beingness, you are identifying with the God part of you. And that being God, can God do anything you wish? 

**STUDENT:** [INAUDIBLE]

**LESTER:** That is secret for he's got a big bank, bigger than the said.

**STUDENT:** I guess that's just talking about…… [INAUDIBLE] because I spend a lot of time affirming my dreamy who I am, and coming, coming from that place of I am, but doing so from my head, doing so from intellectual standpoint. Because how to do it the other way. [INAUDIBLE]

**LESTER:** Do you have the release technique? 

**STUDENT:** Just, yes recently…… [INAUDIBLE]

**LESTER:** When did you finish the course?

**STUDENT:** In January. 

**LESTER:** Okay, should have been free by now. [LAUGHTER] I say it should take it three months or less if you carry out the six steps. I know that because it took me three months, and I didn't have the six steps. They evolved as I went through it. I think I could have possibly done it one month's time, had I the six steps to begin with, at an end with. 

Doesn't need to take time because you are that unlimited being. Where is it? It's your Beingness. Yes, but I'm totally involved in being a body. Use the method, get the mind quiet, and you self-obvious to yourself as to the fact as you are unlimited. It's only the feelings that gathering the I-cannot. 

Now, affirmation is trying to program further good stuff on top of bad stuff - give you more programs to get rid of. Doesn't work anyhow, except for maybe 5%. Has it worked for you? 

**STUDENT:** It did work, for physical feeling. I haven't been used it all the time for that. I haven't went to a doctor for 25 years. [INAUDIBLE]

**LESTER:** OK. Our physical feeling, of course, is better than physical ailment. But you were dealing with the most limited vehicle possible in the universe, a physical body, and validating it and keeping yourself imprisoned.

So that affirmation worked, was excellent to keep yourself bounding around and round and round, you go. Release in the body by mere effortless thought will be perfect. If you want a perfect body. The body is an exact copy of the mind. The mind is something you set up. It's some total collection of all your thoughts and feelings. 

So rid yourself of all your feelings, your mind goes quiet. And you will remain in the infinite Beingness that you are. Conscious of it. Simple, easy if you do it. If you don't do it, it's impossible.

Any other question? Okay, so the sermon is over, the vermin remains, [LAUGHTER] all we have to do is to release it.
